# Descrambler

Write a program that takes a jumble of letters and returns a list of possible words. You'll find the following modules handy:

- `sys`

You'll also need a very large list of words that you can use to search possible return values. Download this file into your current working directory (3.6 MB): [words.txt](https://gitlab.com/steam-labs-code/s0-python/descrambler/-/snippets/3700494)

```bash
python descrambler.py llbe
Possible words: bell
```


## Advanced Challenge:

Try using `argparse` to create a module out of your new program!


```bash
python -m descrambler llbe
Possible words: bell
```
