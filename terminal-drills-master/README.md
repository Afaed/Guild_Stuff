# Terminal Drills

Want to improve your ability to do your work as a programmer? Then you should spend some time practicing
terminal commands!

While this isn't a hard requirement, you'll find that this can help improve your comfort and workflow
as a developer. It's a skill best learned by training your hands to remember the commands.

## Instructions

Each practice exercise has its own directory, each with its own `README.md` which contains the
instructions. 

Remember: practice is the only way to learn this commands. So push yourself by working strictly from
the terminal using the recommended commands!
