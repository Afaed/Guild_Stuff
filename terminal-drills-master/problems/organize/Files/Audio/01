22. Drop magazine in Witt's End for a point.  Get out by entering all different
directions except north.  It may take a while.  Slog around in various and
distant locations until a voice announces that the cave is now closed.  At this
point you are teleported to the two-room Master's Game.
23. Get black rod (with the rusty marks, not the star).  Drop rod in the
northeast room.  Retreat to the southwest room. Type blast. Alternate endings
are possible, but will not yield sufficient points to earn you the rank of
adventure grandmaster.
