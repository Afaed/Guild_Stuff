# Folder Organization Practice

There are a bunch of files in the `Files` folder, but they're in the wrong folders. This won't do!

Organize each file into their appropriate folders using only your terminal commands. 


## Instructions

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Only use this window for the exercise! Open a new window if you need to execute other commands.

If you want your commands reviewed, log your command history to a text file `history` and send it your mentor for review.

You might find the following commands useful:
```bash
ls
mv
grep 
find 
```

Remember there's always more than 1 way to do something, so use any commands that can help you accomplish the task.
