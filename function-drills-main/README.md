# Python Function Drills

Here you'll find lots of short exercises to help you lay the foundation of your Python skills. Each set of challenges has tests: if the tests pass then you successfully found a solution. If not, keep trying until you can get it to pass!

Remember: all solutions are valid. Review your solutions with a mentor to get feedback and add challenge.


## How to Run Tests

In your terminal:

```bash
python3 name_of_script.py
# ..or
python name_of_script.py
```

This will output the test results for each set of drills. Read the results carefully to see the problems you need to solve. Always solve 1 problem at a time.
