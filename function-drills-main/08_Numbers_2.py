def dash_it(number: int) -> str:
    """
    You're working with a list of integers of variable size. Implement the function 
    that adds a dash (-) between each number and returns it as a string.

    The string should not have any dashes in the first and last positions of the string.

    Do not use str.split or str.join.

    Example:
    >>> dash_it(592)
    '5-9-2'
    >>> dash_it(7)
    '7'
    >>> dash_it(-473)
    '4-7-3'
